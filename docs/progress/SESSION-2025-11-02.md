# Session Progress - November 2, 2025

**Date:** 2025-11-02
**Status:** ✅ Strategic Revision Complete
**Phase:** Phase 0 - Week 0 (Validation Sprint)
**Current Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Beachhead & Foundation)

---

## Overview

Completed strategic revision of project approach from 52-week complete build to 16-week validation sprint. Updated roadmap, set trade name, and prepared for focused validation of core technical assumptions.

---

## Major Accomplishments

### ✅ Strategic Approach Revision

**Decision:** Shifted from complete build (52 weeks) to validation-first approach (16 weeks)

**Rationale:**
- Reduces risk for solo founder
- Validates core technical assumptions (ISOXML/ADAPT round-trip, offline reliability) 14 weeks earlier
- Enables go/no-go decision at Week 12 before committing to full 40-week build (Phases 2-5)
- Focuses on highest-risk technical challenges first

**New Timeline:**
- **Weeks 0-2:** Phase 0 (Beachhead & Foundation)
- **Weeks 3-10:** Phase 1 (Interop Core & Foundation)
- **Weeks 11-12:** Pilot Deployment
- **Week 12:** 🎯 Validation Gate (Go/No-Go Decision)
- **Weeks 13-16:** Testing & Refinement
- **Post-validation:** Phases 2-5 (~40 weeks) if validation succeeds

### ✅ Roadmap Updated

**File Modified:** `product/roadmap/2025-2026-fms-roadmap.md`

**Key Changes:**
- Compressed focus to Phases 0-1 only (16 weeks)
- Defined Week 12 validation gate with clear success criteria
- Moved Phases 2-5 (Compliance, Inventory, Finance, Mission Planner) to post-validation roadmap
- Updated success metrics for validation sprint
- Added validation gate criteria:
  - ISOXML/ADAPT round-trip accuracy ≥90% (target ≥95%)
  - Offline job creation and completion working reliably
  - 2 pilot customers deployed and using system
  - No critical blockers or fundamental technical challenges
  - Positive user feedback on core workflow

**Decision Log Updated:**
- 2025-10-31: Complete build approach (52 weeks) → **SUPERSEDED**
- 2025-11-02: **Validation-first approach (16 weeks)** → **ACTIVE**
- Retained: Tech stack, pilot users, multi-tenant architecture

### ✅ Trade Name Set

**Trade Name:** Farm Management

**Updates Made:**
1. `.project-state.json` → `tradeName: "Farm Management"`
2. Projects database (`C:\devop\.config\verdaio-dashboard.db`) → Updated via Python script
3. Verification: `projectId: saas202511, tradeName: Farm Management, status: Planning`

### ✅ Git Repository Updated

**Commits Today:**
1. `72c1e78` - "feat: add foundational tooling configuration and compress roadmap to 16-week validation"
2. `c41db44` - "update: set trade name to Farm Management"

**Files Changed:**
- `product/roadmap/2025-2026-fms-roadmap.md` (major revision)
- `.project-state.json` (trade name)

**Pushed to:** `https://github.com/ChrisStephens1971/saas202511`

## Validation Sprint Focus Areas

### Phase 0: Beachhead & Foundation (Weeks 0-2)

**Objectives:**
- Engage 2 pilot customers (already identified)
- Compile integration matrix (OEM data sources, formats, APIs)
- Spike ISOXML conversion (validate round-trip with real files)
- Spike ADAPT payload import/export
- Set up development environment (FastAPI, Next.js, PostgreSQL + PostGIS)

**Status:** 🔵 Starting Now

### Phase 1: Interop Core & Foundation (Weeks 3-10)

**Objectives:**
- Production-grade ISOXML/ADAPT converters (≥90% round-trip)
- Job engine MVP (create, assign, execute, complete)
- Offline-first engine MVP (SQLite + CRDT merges, vector clocks)
- IAM & multi-tenant (row-level security, basic auth)
- OEM importers (file-based, USB/SD)
- Spatial data foundation (PostGIS boundaries, as-applied polygons)

**Status:** 🔵 Not Started

### Phase 1.5: Pilot Deployment & Testing (Weeks 11-16)

**Objectives:**
- Deploy to 2 pilot customer environments (Week 11)
- **🎯 Week 12 Validation Gate:** Assess round-trip accuracy, offline reliability, user feedback
- Pilot testing & feedback (Weeks 12-14)
- Bug fixes & refinements (Weeks 13-16)
- Validation report (Week 16) - Decision: Proceed to Phases 2-5 or Pivot

**Status:** 🔵 Not Started

## What We're NOT Doing (Validation Sprint)

Explicitly out of scope for 16-week validation:

- ❌ Compliance features → Deferred to Phase 2 (post-validation)
- ❌ Inventory and costing → Deferred to Phase 3 (post-validation)
- ❌ Field-to-finance integration → Deferred to Phase 4 (post-validation)
- ❌ Mission planner and mobile apps → Deferred to Phase 5 (post-validation)
- ❌ OEM API integrations → File-based import only, API deferred if complex
- ❌ Advanced offline conflict resolution → Basic CRDT merges only
- ❌ Fancy UI/UX → Functional workflows first, polish later
- ❌ Multi-party workflow complexity → Basic job assignment only
- ❌ Historical data import → Focus on current season data only

**Focus:** Prove ISOXML/ADAPT conversion and offline reliability work. Everything else is secondary.

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Week 0 - This Week)

### Priority 1: Development Environment Setup
1. Set up FastAPI backend project structure
2. Set up Next.js frontend project structure
3. Initialize PostgreSQL + PostGIS with Docker Compose
4. Verify multi-tenant configuration and row-level security setup

### Priority 2: Pilot Customer Engagement
1. Confirm pilot customer #1 engagement schedule
2. Confirm pilot customer #2 engagement schedule
3. Send data collection kit (templates, CSV schemas, README)
4. Schedule weekly check-ins

### Priority 3: Integration Research
1. Begin integration matrix (OEM data sources, formats)
2. Research ISOXML specification and libraries
3. Research ADAPT specification and libraries
4. Identify real pilot files for spike testing

## Risks and Mitigations (Updated)

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| ISOXML/ADAPT spec complexity | Critical | Spike in Phase 0 (Week 2), validate round-trip with real pilot files | 🟡 To Validate |
| Round-trip accuracy <90% | Critical | Allocate extra time in Weeks 7-8, consider hiring specialist if needed | 🟡 Monitoring |
| Pilot customer engagement | High | **Already identified** - Maintain weekly check-ins, clear expectations | 🟢 Mitigated |
| Offline sync conflicts | High | CRDT research in Week 1, build basic conflict resolution, extensive testing | 🟡 To Address |
| Solo founder capacity (16 weeks) | Medium | Ruthless prioritization, defer nice-to-haves, 60-hour weeks acceptable for sprint | 🟡 Monitoring |
| OEM API access restrictions | Medium | Focus on file-based import (USB/SD), defer API to post-validation | 🟢 Mitigated |

---

## Resource Allocation (Validation Sprint)

### Team Capacity
- **Solo Founder:** Full-stack development, product, architecture
- **Hiring plan:** Revisit after Week 12 validation. If proceeding to Phases 2-5, consider backend engineer.

### Effort Distribution (16 Weeks)
- 60% - Core feature development (Phases 0-1)
- 20% - Integration and data conversion (ISOXML/ADAPT, spikes)
- 15% - Pilot deployment, testing, and support
- 5% - Documentation and validation reporting

---

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-10-31 | Complete build approach (52 weeks before V1) | **SUPERSEDED** - Original plan was too risky for solo founder |
| 2025-11-02 | **Validation-first approach (16 weeks)** | Compress to Phases 0-1 only, validate core assumptions by Week 12, reduce risk by 14 weeks. Proceed to Phases 2-5 only if validation succeeds. |
| 2025-11-02 | Set trade name to "Farm Management" | Simple, clear, descriptive name for the product |
| 2025-11-02 | Mobile apps deferred to Phase 5 (post-validation) | Web-first for validation sprint. Mobile deferred until after Week 12 validation gate. |
| 2025-11-02 | OEM API integrations made optional | File-based import (USB/SD) sufficient for validation. API integration deferred to post-validation if complex. |
